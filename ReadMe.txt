How to run this project:
1. Open all the .m files in MATLAB
2. Run all the function files one to add to the MATLAB path(this would give less parameters error)
3. Then run the file titled as 'main.m'
4. Output would be the similarity metric of two currency notes.
5. This project can not be applied to the new Indian currency notes as the test section coordinates were decided
   and embedded in the program which were according to the old currency notes.
   For ex: the position of the Mahatma Gandhi Potrait
